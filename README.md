# Product Website Template by ConductionNL

The [Product Website Template](https://github.com/ConductionNL/product-website-template) by ConductionNL is a powerful tool designed to alleviate the common issue faced by many open-source and Common Ground projects: the lack of a dedicated product page. This template enables users to quickly and easily set up a product page based on the contents of their repository.

The template is highly customizable, allowing users to style their product page using their organization's NL design token. This means that you can maintain a consistent look and feel across all your products and services, reinforcing your brand identity.

One of the key advantages of this template is its simplicity. You can have a fully functional product page up and running in a matter of minutes, without the need to write any additional code. This not only saves time but also makes it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer to the world of open-source projects, the Product Website Template is a valuable resource that can help you showcase your work in a professional and appealing manner.

## Using this template for your own github repository

1. Download [the github workflow](https://github.com/ConductionNL/product-website-template)  file 
2. Place it in your repro in the `.github/workflows` folder (create the folder if you don't have one).
3. Change the basic configuration of the workflow to your own personal liking
4. Commit and Push the file to your repository

If you don't have github pages setup yet, also follow the following steps

1. **Open your web browser and navigate to GitHub.**
   Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com).

2. **Log in to your GitHub account.**
   Click on the "Sign in" button at the top right corner of the page. Enter your username or email address and password, then click "Sign in".

3. **Navigate to the repository where you want to activate GitHub Pages.**
   You can do this by clicking on the name of the repository under "Your repositories" if it's a recent repository, or by clicking on "Repositories", then clicking on the name of the repository.

4. **Switch to the `gh-pages` branch.**
   By default, GitHub shows the `main` or `master` branch of your repository. To switch to the `gh-pages` branch, click on the "Branch" dropdown menu (it's usually a button with the name of the current branch, like `main` or `master`), then select or type `gh-pages` and hit Enter.

   If the `gh-pages` branch doesn't exist, you'll need to create it. Click on the "Branch" dropdown menu, type `gh-pages` into the text box, and hit Enter. Confirm that you want to create a new branch named `gh-pages`.

5. **Activate GitHub Pages.**
   Click on the "Settings" tab at the top of the repository. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. In the "Source" dropdown, select the `gh-pages` branch. For the folder, make sure it's set to "/ (root)".

6. **Save your changes.**
   Click on the "Save" button to activate GitHub Pages.

7. **Confirm that GitHub Pages has been activated.**
   After saving, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section again. You should see a message saying "Your site is published at [link]". This link is where your GitHub Pages site can be accessed.
